<!--
Create a new changelog entry for every change in the repository.

Please adhere to the following instructions:
* Add a new bullet item for the category that best describes the change.
* You may optionally append "(by @<author>)" at the end of the bullet item,
  where @<author> is the GitHub username of the author of the change. These
  affiliations will be displayed in the release notes for every release.
* The accepted categories are: Removed, Added, Changed, Deprecated, Fixed,
  and Security.
* Indicate breaking changes with a "**BREAKING CHANGE:**" prefix in the
  bullet item.

Uncomment the section that is right (remove the HTML comment wrapper).
For top level release notes, leave all the headers commented out.
